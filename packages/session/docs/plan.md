# H3-Session Package Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to optimize the h3-session package, a session management library for H3 (Nitro/Nuxt) applications. The plan focuses on improving performance, security, maintainability, and developer experience, with special consideration for serverless environments.

## Goals

- Improve overall performance and reduce memory footprint
- Enhance security measures for session handling
- Modernize codebase with latest TypeScript and Angular best practices
- Add comprehensive testing and documentation
- Implement additional session stores and features
- Optimize for serverless environments and edge computing

## Tasks

### 1. Code Structure and Architecture Optimization

1.1. **Refactor Core Session Management Logic**
   - [x] Extract common cryptographic functions to a separate utility module
   - [x] Improve type safety with stricter TypeScript types
   - [x] Apply immutability patterns for session data handling
   - [x] Refactor Session class to use modern ES private fields consistently

1.2. **Optimize Memory Usage**
   - [x] Implement LRU cache for crypto keys to prevent memory leaks
     > ✅ Highly relevant for serverless: Prevents unbounded memory growth and optimized for ephemeral environments
   - [ ] Review and optimize caching strategies for session data
     > ⚠️ Requires adjustment: Focus on external persistent caching rather than in-memory caching since serverless functions can be terminated at any time
   - [ ] Use WeakMap for storing cryptographic keys when appropriate
     > ❌ Limited value in serverless: Functions are short-lived and memory is reclaimed automatically, consider replacing with on-demand resource allocation

1.3. **Modernize Code Structure**
   - [x] Convert to a more modular architecture
     > ✅ Completed: Restructured codebase into logical modules with clear separation of concerns. Moved source files from `/lib` to a structured `/src` directory with dedicated folders for core functionality, stores, types, and utilities. Enhanced type safety by improving interfaces and fixing type-related issues.
    - [x] Implement barrel exports for better import experience
     > ✅ Completed: Added index.ts barrel files across the project structure (core, stores, types, utils) to simplify imports. This allows consumers to import from a single path rather than knowing internal file structures, improving developer experience and maintaining better encapsulation.
   - [x] Refactor to use standalone functions where appropriate
     > ✅ Critical for serverless/edge: Enables better tree-shaking, reduces initialization overhead, minimizes bundle size, and improves cold start performance by eliminating class instantiation costs

### 2. Performance Optimizations

2.1. **Cryptographic Operations**
   - [ ] Batch cryptographic operations where possible
   - [ ] Implement lazy initialization for cryptographic keys
     > ✅ Critical for serverless: Reduces cold start times by initializing only when needed
   - [ ] Optimize signature verification process

2.2. **Session Storage and Retrieval**
   - [ ] Implement bulk operations for session management
   - [ ] Add compression options for large session data
   - [ ] Optimize cookie parsing and generation

2.3. **Caching Strategy**
   - [ ] Implement multi-level caching for frequently accessed sessions
   - [ ] Add configurable TTL for in-memory session cache
   - [ ] Optimize cache invalidation strategies

### 3. Security Enhancements

3.1. **Session Security**
   - [ ] Add rotation of session IDs after authentication

   - [ ] Add CSRF protection mechanisms

3.2. **Cryptographic Improvements**
   - [ ] Support for newer cryptographic algorithms

   - [ ] Create session context utilities for easier access

4.3. **Developer Experience**

   - [ ] Create performance benchmarks

5.2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Generate API documentation with TypeDoc
   - [ ] Create usage examples and tutorials
   - [ ] Document security best practices


### 6. Serverless Environment Optimizations

6.1. **Cold Start Performance**
   - [ ] Minimize initialization overhead through lazy loading
   - [ ] Implement warm-up strategies for critical operations
   - [ ] Optimize cryptographic operation initialization

6.2. **Stateless Architecture Support**
   - [ ] Ensure all session operations can work without persistent memory between invocations

6.3. **Connection Management**
   - [ ] Implement connection pooling for database session stores
   - [ ] Add automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff
   - [ ] Optimize connection lifecycle for short-lived function executions

6.4. **Memory Optimization**
