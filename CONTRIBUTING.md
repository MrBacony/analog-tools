## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to foster a welcoming and respectful community.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally:
   ```zsh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/analog-tools.git
   cd analog-tools
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (requires Node.js v18.13.0+ and npm):
   ```zsh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up Nx CLI** (optional, for global usage):
   ```zsh
   npm install -g nx
   ```

## Project Structure

This is an [Nx](https://nx.dev/) monorepo. Key directories:

- `apps/` â€“ Demo Application projects (e.g., analog-example)
- `packages/` â€“ Reusable libraries (auth, logger, etc.)
- `docs/` â€“ Documentation
- `docker/` â€“ Docker, keycloak and redis

## Development Workflow

- Use Nx for all development tasks (build, test, lint, etc.):
  ```zsh
  npx nx run <project>:<target>
  # Example: npx nx run analog-example:serve
  ```
- Generate new libraries, components, or apps using Nx generators:
  ```zsh
  npx nx g @nx/angular:component my-component --project=analog-example
  ```
- Use feature branches for your work:
  ```zsh
  git checkout -b feat/my-feature
  ```

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear commit history:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

## Testing

- Run all tests:
  ```zsh
  npx nx run-many --target=vite:test --all
  ```
- Run tests for a specific project:
  ```zsh
  npx nx run <project>:vite:test
  ```

## Code Style

- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code quality and formatting.
- Lint your code before pushing:
  ```zsh
  npx nx run-many --target=lint --all
  ```
- Follow the Angular, AnalogJS, and Nx style guides.

## Pull Requests
